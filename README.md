# Tanks-game
Tanks is a multiplayer game in development. The server is made in C and the graphics in Pygame.

I wanted to learn how to create a server using sockets. A game is a great and fun way of learning.

Check this video to see what I've done so far.

## How to run 

On Ubuntu, run the server executable and leave it open.

Install pygame. Open several command lines and run game.py.
### warning 
If you move any square inside the game before you open a new client it won't be sinchronized, this will be fixed once the project is done.
